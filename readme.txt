With TK Reminders you'll never forget you had to edit something before you publish.

== Description ==

TK Reminder is a plugin that will show a notice on the admin panel telling you
if you have pending reminders. It will also make the `Publish` button a different
color to call your attention.

**Important**: TK Reminders will not block you from publishing, it will just
make it visible that you have reminders in your post but if you wish to publish
with them you can still do so.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `tk-reminders` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
